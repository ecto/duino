# duino

A framework for working with Arduinos in node.js

![arduino](http://i.imgur.com/eFq84.jpg)

# install

    npm install duino

# usage

````javascript
var arduino = require('duino'),
    board = new arduino.Board();

var led = new arduino.Led({
  board: board,
  pin: 13
});

led.blink();
````

# what ಠ_ಠ

The way this works is simple (in theory, not in practice). The Arduino listens for low-level signals over a serial port, while we abstract all of the logic on the Node side.

1.  Plug in your Arduino
2.  Upload the C code at `./src/du.ino` to it
3.  Write a simple **duino** script
4.  ?????
5.  Profit!

# libraries

##board

Right now, the board library will attempt to autodiscover the Arduino. I'm going to make it configurable, don't worry.

````javascript
var board = new arduino.Board({
  debug: true
});
````

Debug mode is off by default. Turning it on will enable verbose logging in your terminal, and tell the Arduino board to echo everthing back to you. You will get something like this:

![debug](http://i.imgur.com/gBYZA.png)

The **board** object is an EventEmitter. You can listen for the following events:

* `data` messages from the serial port, delimited by newlines
* `connected` when the serial port has connected
* `ready` when all internal post-connection logic has finished and the board is ready to use

````javascript
board.on('ready', function(){
  // do stuff
});

board.on('data', function(m){
  console.log(m);
}
````

###board.serial

Low-level access to the serial connection to the board

###board.write(msg)

Write a message to the board, wrapped in predefined delimiters (! and .)

###board.pinMode(pin, mode)

Set the mode for a pin. `mode` is either `'in'` or `'out'`

###board.digitalWrite(pin, val)

Write one of the following to a pin:

####board.HIGH and board.LOW

Constants for use in low-level digital writes

###board.analogWrite(pin,val)

Write a value between 0-255 to a pin

##led

````javascript
var led = new arduino.Led({
  board: board,
  pin: 13
});
````

Pin will default to 13.

###led.on()

Turn the LED on

###led.off()

Turn the LED off

###led.blink(interval)

Blink the LED at `interval` ms. Defaults to 1000

###led.fade(interval)

Fade the to full brightness then back to minimal brightness in `interval` ms. Defaults to 2000

###led.bright

Current brightness of the LED

##piezo

````javascript
var led = new arduino.Piezo({
  board: board,
  pin: 13
});
````
Pin will default to 13.

###piezo.note(note, duration)

Play a pre-calculated note for a given duration (in milliseconds).

`note` must be a string, one of `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `a`, `b`, or `c` (must be lowercase)

###piezo.tone(tone, duration)

Write a square wave to the piezo element.

`tone` and `duration` must be integers. See code comments for math on `tone` generation.

##button

````javascript
var button = new arduino.Button({
  board: board,
  pin: 13
});
````
Pin will default to 13.

Buttons are simply EventEmitters. They will emit the events `up` and `down`. You may also access their `down` property.

````javascript
button.on('down', function(){
  // delete the database!
  console.log('BOOM');
});

setInterval(function(){
  console.log(button.down);
}, 1000);
````

##servo

````javascript
var servo = new arduino.Servo({
  board: board
});

servo.write(0);
servo.write(180);
````
Pin will default to 9. (Arduino PWM default)

###servo.sweep()

Increment position from 0 to 180.

###servo.write(pos)

Instruct the servo to immediately go to a position from 0 to 180.

##joystick

There are 4 events to handle ups/downs on X and Y axis.

````javascript
var joystick = new arduino.JoyStick({
  board: board
});

joystick.on('y-up',function(amount,real_volts){
    console.log('Y Increasing, amount:',amount,real_volts);
});

joystick.on('y-down',function(amount,real_volts){
  console.log('Y Decreasing , amount:',amount,real_volts);
});

joystick.on('x-up',function(amount,real_volts){
  console.log('X Increasing , amount:',amount,real_volts);
});

joystick.on('x-down',function(amount,real_volts){
  console.log('X Decreasing , amount:',amount,real_volts);
});

````
VRYPin is by default A0, VRXPin  is by default A1, but they can be specified in the options:

````javascript
var joystick = new arduino.JoyStick({
  board: board,
  vrypin: 'A0',
  vrxpin: 'A1'
});

````
Each event returns 2 parameters: "amount" that is a percentage and "real_voltage":

````javascript

joystick.on('x-down',function(amount,real_volts){
  console.log('X Decreasing , amount:',amount,real_volts);
});

````


##motor

##potentiometer

# protocol

Each message sent to the Arduino board by the **board** class has 8 bytes.

A full message looks like this:

    !0113001.

`!` Start
`01` Command (digitalWrite)
`13` Pin number
`001` Value (high)
`.` Stop

I was drunk. It works.

##command

What is implemented right now:

*  `00` pinMode
*  `01` digitalWrite
*  `02` digitalRead
*  `03` analogWrite
*  `04` analogRead
*  `99` debug

##pin

Pins can be sent as an integer or a string(`1`, `2`, `"3"`, `"A0"`)

##value

*  `board.LOW`(`0`)
*  `board.HIGH`(`255`)
*  integer/string from `0`-`255` for PWM pins
